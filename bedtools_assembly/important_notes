GFF file is 1-based coordinate 
and 
Bed file is 0-based corrdinate 



Use exact coordinate as gff file gives wrong fasta sequence 
To correct this use following command 

start_pos_in_bed_format=str(int(l[3])-1)
where l[3] is the start coordinate in gff3 files. 



bedtools getfasta -fi Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa -bed exon.bed -s -name -fo exon.fa
bedtools getfasta -fi Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa -bed intron.bed -s -name -fo intron.fa


s tag is important to get the strand specific sequences

Following tools from bedops also can be used to convert from gff3 format to bed format. But I can do it in python also. So lets not use it. 

gff2bed <gencode.vM28.annotation.gff3> gencode.bed
